# Awesome Cuda

This is a list of useful libraries and resources for CUDA
development.

## Presentations

* [Optimizing Parallel Reduction in CUDA](https://web.archive.org/web/20160729221949/https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/samples/6_Advanced/reduction/doc/reduction.pdf) - In this presentation it is shown how a fast, but relatively simple, reduction
algorithm can be implemented.

* [CUDA C/C++ BASICS](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Intro_to_CUDA_C-TS.pdf) - This presentations explains the concepts of CUDA kernels,
memory management, threads, thread blocks, shared memory, thread
syncrhonization. A simple addition kernel is shown, and an optimized stencil
1D stencil kernel is shown.

* [Advanced CUDA - Optimizing to Get 20x
  Performance](https://www.nvidia.com/content/cudazone/download/Advanced_CUDA_Training_NVISION08.pdf) - This presentation covers: Tesla 10-Series Architecture, Particle
